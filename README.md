# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Overview
The purpose of this project was to perform analysis on the employees. In this case we were performing the analyis to future proof the company. We wanted to know how many employees were going into retirement in the foreseeable future so we could plan accordingly. This means ramping up initiatives to hire more people so the company does not see overwhelming number of vacancies when we start to see an increase in retiring employees. Planning ahead in this case will ensure a smooth transition phase and will allow the company time to gather resources and personnel to hire and train new employees. 

### Results
The first point I'd like to make is that from the employees that retiring but they seem to be rather experienced. Losing such expertise has the potential to end poorly if we do not take appropriate action. We need to ensure we are looking to hire people with enough experience to maintain these soon to be vacant roles.
