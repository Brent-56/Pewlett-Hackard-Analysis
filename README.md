# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Overview
The purpose of this project was to perform analysis on the employees. In this case we were performing the analyis to future proof the company. We wanted to know how many employees were going into retirement in the foreseeable future so we could plan accordingly. This means ramping up initiatives to hire more people so the company does not see overwhelming number of vacancies when we start to see an increase in retiring employees. Planning ahead in this case will ensure a smooth transition phase and will allow the company time to gather resources and personnel to hire and train new employees.
